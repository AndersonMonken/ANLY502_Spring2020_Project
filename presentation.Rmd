## Motivation

* How can we use big data to better understand developing countries?
* Can we figure out how to determine true economic data when official statistics are wrong or unavailable?
* GOAL: Use satellites to track changes in light along with other traditional economic variables to predict GDP per capita

<!--look to the night sky-->

## Data Prep

* Yearly satellite data from NOAA 1993-2013
* Other economic data sourced from World Bank, IMF, OECD
* Used GeoPySpark to load and process the satellite data
* Polygonal mean of shapes for each country using pycountry
* We found out how annoying map projections can be in spark

```

## EDA - light data processed

## EDA - light data indexed to 1993

## Preliminary Results
* Linear regression (mean light only) RMSE = $17,361
* Linear regression RMSE = $14,312
* Random forest regression RMSE = $5,838

## Summary
* Try other mode types, model parameters, and do more visualizations
