## Motivation

* How can we use big data to better understand developing countries?
* Use satellites to track changes in GDP and track other measures social development
* Can we see how oppressive regimes are affecting economic development when we know official statistics are wrong?

## Dataset

* Yearly Satellite data from NOAA 1993-2013
* Used GeoPySpark to load and process the data
* Polygonal mean of shape files for each country
