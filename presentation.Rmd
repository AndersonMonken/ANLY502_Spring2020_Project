## Motivation

* How can we use big data to better understand developing countries?
* Can we figure out how to determine true economic data when official statistics are wrong or unavailable?
* Use satellites to track changes in GDP and other measures social development

<!--look to the night sky-->

## Dataset

* Yearly Satellite data from NOAA 1993-2013
* Used GeoPySpark to load and process the data
* Polygonal mean of shape files for each country
* We found out how annoying map projections can be in spark

## Next Steps
* Random forest regression RMSE = $5,838
* Linear regression RMSE = $14,312
* Try new model paramters and do more visualizations
* Takeaways so far: using big data, Spark, Spark packages, geodata
